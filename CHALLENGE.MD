#Are you our next backend superstar?

##Technical Challenge
Please, keep in mind OOP, software design patterns, code architecture, tests, and accuracy in implementation during development.

Here you need to build an application that can calculate the salary of employees.  
We need to have an expandable system of bonuses or deductions.

##Explanation
Country Tax for salaries is 20%

If an employee older than 50 we want to add 7% to his salary  
If an employee has more than 2 kids we want to decrease his Tax by 2%  
If an employee wants to use a company car we need to deduct $500  

##Situation
Alice is 26 years old, she has 2 kids and her salary is $6000  
Bob is 52, he is using a company car and his salary is $4000  
Charlie is 36, he has 3 kids, company car and his salary is $5000
  
##The end

Please, add brief instructions on how to build, run, and test your application.
